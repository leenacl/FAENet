# FAENet

**FAENet** is a research project focusing on robust RGB-D semantic segmentation for underground mine scenes under complex degradation conditions.

This repository currently serves as an official placeholder for the FAENet project.  
The implementation and pretrained models will be released after the acceptance of the corresponding paper.

## Background

RGB-D semantic segmentation is a fundamental technique for environmental perception in intelligent mining systems.  

FAENet is motivated by the need for a robust multimodal perception framework that can adapt to complex degradation patterns in underground mines while maintaining stable semantic prediction and strong generalization ability.
